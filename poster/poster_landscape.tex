Previous researches have shown that learning multiple representations for polysemous words can improve the performance of word embeddings on many tasks. However, this leads to another problem. Several vectors of a word may actually point to the same meaning, namely pseudo multi-sense. 
\par
We introduce the concept of pseudo multi-sense, and then propose an algorithm to detect such cases. With the consideration of the detected pseudo multi-sense cases, we try to refine the existing word embeddings to eliminate the influence of pseudo multi-sense. Moreover, we apply our algorithm on previous released multi-sense word embeddings and tested it on artificial word similarity tasks and the analogy task. The result of the experiments shows that diminishing pseudo multi-sense can improve the quality of word representations. Thus, our method is actually an efficient way to reduce linguistic complexity for computer's natural language understanding.

\noindent\textbf{\large Domain Similarity}
\par To determine the domain of a sense given the multi-sense word embeddings, we can intuitively define the probability that the $k^{th}$ sense of word $w$ belongs to domain $d$ as 
\begin{equation} \label{pdomain}
P_D(w, k, d) \propto  {\sum_{w' \in NN(w, k)} D(p(w'), d)} \nonumber
\end{equation}
where $NN(w,k)$ is the nearest neighbors of the $k^{th}$ sense of word $w$ in the given word embeddings, $p(w')$ is the protocol representation of word $w'$, $D(p(w'), d)$ is the sum probability that domain $d$ appears in all synsets of $p(w')$ in WordNet(\cite{wordnet}) provided by Extended WordNet Domain. Then we can compute the domain similarity between the $k^{th}$ and the $l^{th}$ sense of word $w$ by
\begin{equation}
Sim_D(w,k,l) = \frac 1n|TopN(P_D,w,k,n) \cap TopN(P_D,w,l,n)| \nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent\textbf{\large Semantic Similarity}
\par 
Analogously, we can define semantic similarity.
\begin{equation} \label{simh}
Sim_H(w,k,l) = \frac 1n|TopN(P_H,w,k,n) \cap TopN(P_H,w,l,n)| \nonumber
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation} \label{phyper}
P_H(w, k, h) \propto \frac{1}{d(w,h)} {\sum_{w' \in NN(w, k)} H(p(w'), h)} \cdot \frac{1}{d(p(w'),h)} \nonumber
\end{equation}
\noindent\textbf{\large Overall Similarity}
\par
We sum the domain similarity and the semantic similarity to get the overall similarity of two sense. 
\begin{equation} \label{simall}
Sim(w,k,l) = Sim_D(w,k,l) + Sim_H(w,k,l) \nonumber
\end{equation}
\par
With a development dataset, we set a threshold $\theta$ for regarding two senses of a word as pseudo multi-sense.
\\~\\
\noindent\textbf{\large Detected Samples}
\par 
Here shows nearest neighbors three "senses" of word {\sl rock} from the released vectors in \cite{neelakantan}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{blue}\textbf{rock$_1$}: metal, rippling, psychedelia, bands, pop}
\item {\color{orange}\textbf{rock$_2$}: sand, rocks, butte, ash, sandy, cedar}
\item {\color{blue}\textbf{rock$_3$}: hip, indie, hop, reggae, roll, rock/metal}
\end{itemize}
Our algorithm shows that rock$_1$ and rock$_3$ are likely to be pseudo multi-sense, while rock$_2$ has a different meaning with them.

\indent{}Speed is achieved by preprocessing the video with an adaptive filter
bank as in~\cite{awf:tracking}. Preprocessing was sped up significantly, but is
still slower than realtime.

This encodes the video into 16 byte per pixel feature vectors. We implemented
an efficient search for similar patches using the SIMD hardware of modern
processors, and only evaluate the cost on these candidate patches. (Typically
200 patches per frame). Candidate search and reasoning are highly efficient
resulting in an interactive system.

Note that the preprocessing is not specific to the interestpoints tracked
later. A single preprocessed video can therefore be used in many annotation
sessions.

Polysemous words are ubiquitous in natural languages. For example, in the following two sentences, the word {\sl star} has different meanings, leaving all metaphorical considerations aside.
\begin{spacing}{-0.5} \end{spacing}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep -2pt
\item She is a famous movie \textbf{star}.
\item That small \textbf{star} is brightest. 
\end{itemize}

Some previous approaches have learned multiple embeddings to represent different senses of a word, discriminating the senses by their context, related syntax and topics. However, this leads to another problem. The methods may embed one sense to multiple vectors by mistake. We call such cases \textbf{pseudo multi-sense}. 
\par
Consider three different representations of word {\sl bear} released by \cite{neelakantan}. We show 9 nearest neighbors for each representation. Words clearly related to the domain {\sl animals} are bolded.
\begin{spacing}{-0.5} \end{spacing}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
\item emerald, \textbf{bears}, \textbf{three-toed}, \textbf{snake}, \textbf{periwinkle}, \textbf{ruffed}, \textbf{hoopoe}, distinctive, unmistakable
\item \textbf{bird}, \textbf{wolf}, arrow, \textbf{pelican}, emerald, canyon, diamond, \textbf{buck}, \textbf{deer}
\item pride, lady, hide, king, gift, crane, afflict, promise, reap
\end{itemize}
\begin{spacing}{0.5} \end{spacing}
We could infer that the first two representations are likely to have the same meaning, namely they two are likely to form a pseudo multi-sense case. But the last representation may have different meaning with them (real multi-sense).
