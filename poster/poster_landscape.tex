Previous researches have shown that learning multiple representations for polysemous words can improve the performance of word embeddings on many tasks. However, this leads to another problem. Several vectors of a word may actually point to the same meaning, namely pseudo multi-sense. 
\par
We introduce the concept of pseudo multi-sense, and then propose an algorithm to detect such cases. With the consideration of the detected pseudo multi-sense cases, we try to refine the existing word embeddings to eliminate the influence of pseudo multi-sense. Moreover, we apply our algorithm on previous released multi-sense word embeddings and tested it on artificial word similarity tasks and the analogy task. The result of the experiments shows that diminishing pseudo multi-sense can improve the quality of word representations. Thus, our method is actually an efficient way to reduce linguistic complexity for computer's natural language understanding.

    Between one and three user clicks were needed to achieve accurate tracking for
      the head sequence. Note the correct handling of the occluded ear, which
      required only a single click.

\indent{}Speed is achieved by preprocessing the video with an adaptive filter
bank as in~\cite{awf:tracking}. Preprocessing was sped up significantly, but is
still slower than realtime.

This encodes the video into 16 byte per pixel feature vectors. We implemented
an efficient search for similar patches using the SIMD hardware of modern
processors, and only evaluate the cost on these candidate patches. (Typically
200 patches per frame). Candidate search and reasoning are highly efficient
resulting in an interactive system.

Note that the preprocessing is not specific to the interestpoints tracked
later. A single preprocessed video can therefore be used in many annotation
sessions.

Polysemous words are ubiquitous in natural languages. For example, in the following two sentences, the word {\sl star} has different meanings, leaving all metaphorical considerations aside.
\begin{spacing}{-0.5} \end{spacing}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep -2pt
\item She is a famous movie \textbf{star}.
\item That small \textbf{star} is brightest. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{spacing}{0.5} \end{spacing}
Some previous approaches have learned multiple embeddings to represent different senses of a word, discriminating the senses by their context, related syntax and topics. However, this leads to another problem. The methods may embed one sense to multiple vectors by mistake. We call such cases \textbf{pseudo multi-sense}. 
\par
Consider three different representations of word {\sl bear} released by \cite{neelakantan}. We show 9 nearest neighbors for each representation. Words clearly related to the domain {\sl animals} are bolded.
\begin{spacing}{-0.5} \end{spacing}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
\item emerald, \textbf{bears}, \textbf{three-toed}, \textbf{snake}, \textbf{periwinkle}, \textbf{ruffed}, \textbf{hoopoe}, distinctive, unmistakable
\item \textbf{bird}, \textbf{wolf}, arrow, \textbf{pelican}, emerald, canyon, diamond, \textbf{buck}, \textbf{deer}
\item pride, lady, hide, king, gift, crane, afflict, promise, reap
\end{itemize}
\begin{spacing}{0.5} \end{spacing}
We could infer that the first two representations are likely to have the same meaning, namely they two are likely to form a pseudo multi-sense case. But the last representation may have different meaning with them (real multi-sense).

  \indent We incorporate a background model, such that a click tells us not only `this
  is how the landmark looks like', but also `this is how the landmark
  does \emph{not} look like' for all other patches in that frame.

  The figure contrasts the per frame evidence for each candidate patch with and
  without a background model. Using the background model makes the correct
  patch probable enough, that it is chosen. But note that global reasoning over
  the entire path is still necessary, as the correct patch is not the most
  probable patch in this frame.
